                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Groove 101 enjoy playing a wide repertoire of funk, soul and&nbsp;pop hits from classic tunes from the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s through to neo soul grooves and modern club anthems. These tracks have been carefully selected to keep the dance floor filled and your guests smiling. Popular choices include Mercy by Duffy, Superstition by Stevie Wonder and Valerie by Amy Winehouse.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">How long does it take you to set up your equipment?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>It normally takes us around an hour and a half to set up all our equipment and to sound-check. It’s worth making the venue aware of this in advance, to avoid any confusion on the day itself.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-question">How long will you play?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We typically play two sets, each lasting around one hour.&nbsp;But this can be tailored to suit your needs, so if you’d prefer three shorter sets – or one long one – we’re happy to oblige. Some clients also choose our popular instrumental upgrade, where we play live subtle background music to enhance a dinner, or when guests are arriving.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">Will you learn our special song?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Please let us know at the time of booking if you would like us to play a particular song, so we have time to arrange and rehearse your choice. We will be happy to learn the track you have chosen, however in certain rare cases highly produced songs (e.g. with orchestral backing, choirs, or sound effects), may be hard to replicate live. In such circumstances, in consultation with you, we may recommend playing a pre-recorded digital version of the song through our sound system.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">Can guests sing along with the band?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We are very happy for the audience to participate, however if you would like guests to sing a tune using the band’s microphones we would ask you to let us know prior to the event, as experience has unfortunately taught us the pitfalls that can potentially result from having&nbsp; impromptu singers on stage.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">Can we use your sound system for speeches?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You are welcome to use our microphones and PA system for your speeches once we have set up our equipment. However please be aware that we do not routinely use radio mics in our live set up; if you need them, please let us know in advance.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">Are you able to DJ between sets?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Included at no extra cost is a DJ service for when we’re not performing ‘on stage’, keeping your guests entertained throughout. We can play songs from our wide selection of tracks or plug your iPod or tablet into our sound system to feature your own playlist. The choice is yours.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">How far do you travel?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most of our bookings are in Kent (where we’re based) but we often travel further afield. Just drop us a line and we’ll quickly let you know if your event location would be feasible for us.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">How will you be dressed?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We will be guided by you. Unless otherwise requested the band normally dresses smartly and subtly in a professional manner. We can also provide a decade themed package e.g. 60’s, 70’s and wear clothes in keeping with that era.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">What facilities do you require?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We ideally need a stage area of 5 x 3 metres and a minimum of two electrical sockets. We would also require access to the playing area at least 1½ hours prior to the event – to set up our gear and sound check. Lastly we would be grateful for a room to get changed in&nbsp;(your venue should be happy to provide this free of charge)&nbsp;and some food (we normally eat from the buffet but a round of sandwiches would be perfectly fine too).</p>

                <button class="faq-question">How much do you charge?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>This all depends on the location and nature of your event so it wouldn’t be fair for us to quote a blanket figure without knowing a little more. Please feel free to contact us to discuss your precise requirements so we can provide you with a no-obligation quotation. The good news is that by booking direct you won’t have to pay expensive agency fees, which sometimes can be as high as 25% of the total&nbsp;amount.</p>

                <button class="faq-question">Got a question that's not answered here?</button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>If you have questions we haven’t answered here then please get in touch. It doesn’t matter how trivial they may seem – if they’re important to you, they’re important to us. After all, it’s your event so it’s only natural you want to prepare thoroughly so that everything runs smoothly on the day.</p>
